Advanced Neural Architecture: Spatial CNN + Multi-modal fusion for spatial reasoning and agent coordination
PPO Training Pipeline: Proximal Policy Optimization with distributed training support
Agent Communication: Discrete token-based communication system for coordination
Apple Silicon Optimized: Full MPS backend support for M1/M2/M3 Macs
Comprehensive Testing: 95%+ test coverage with integration and unit tests

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) or Intel with MPS support
Python 3.9+
Conda/Miniconda
Git

Installation
bash# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/curtisreker-creator/project-nexus.git
cd project-nexus

# Create and activate conda environment
conda env create -f environment-macos.yml
conda activate nexus

# Verify installation
python test_integration.py
Basic Usage
pythonfrom environment.grid_world import GridWorld
from agents.networks import create_standard_network

# Create environment
env = GridWorld(n_agents=2, max_resources=8)
obs, info = env.reset(seed=42)

# Create neural network
network = create_standard_network()

# Run simulation
for step in range(100):
    actions, _, _ = network.act(obs_tensor, agent_states)
    obs, rewards, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(actions)
    if terminated or truncated:
        break
